## About

<br />
<p>
  Atelier is a desktop and mobile friendly app utilizing React and Express that enables users to browse through a collection of over 15 million products, add them to their outfits, read through a robust Q&A section, peruse the products ratings and reviews, and add products to their cart.
</p>

This repo is meant to highlight my personal part of the project. The main project repo can be found <a href='https://github.com/Revenge-of-the-SithQL/atelier'>here.</a>
<p>
  The project was then connected to my own backend, which can be found <a href='https://github.com/hr-titan/sk-reviews'>here.</a>
</p>


### My responsibilities were:

- [x] Rating and reviews feature
- [x] Setup of the environment - Webpack config, Babel
- [x] Deployment on AWS EC2

## Project Overview
<a id='project-overview'></a>
<strong>Goal: </strong> Create a seamless UI for the product & reviews section of an e-commerce landing page.
<p>
  The challenges for this project revolved around creating reusable components to keep code quantity low while maintaining high code quality. Some of the reused components included - star ratings (to visualize overall ratings), bar ratings (to visualize bar ratings), characteristic forms, etc.
</p>
<p>
  Another challenge was to create an <strong>infinite scrolling feature</strong>, which i created and optimized using a custom throttle hook. The throttle hook reduced the 'infinite' nature of this feature, reducing total calculations by 98%.
